With the new aperture settings and OIS, videos shot in darker settings with iPhone 7 are also much more enhanced than those taken by its older siblings.The 7MP FaceTime HD camera is as amazing as it can be. It uses wide color capture to take sharper and more vibrant selfies. The Retina Flash matches the ambient light for a shot to produce natural-looking skin tones.On the storage front, Apple has abandoned its signature 16GB storage variant and starts the line with 32GB of storage, which is further followed by 128GB and 256GB. Memory expansion, however, remains non-existent.",
