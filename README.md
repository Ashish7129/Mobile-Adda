# Mobile Adda

Develop an [Online Mobile Store](https://mobile-adda.surge.sh) using React. Application should display the list of mobiles. User should be able to search mobiles, view details of the product, add the product to the cart and place order. Following are the key functional aspects:
• Show the list of products
• This list of products should be fetched from local json server via an api call (refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

• Filter the list, based on search

• Sort the list of products on the basis of price (High to Low, Low to High)

• View details of the product item

• Add item to the cart from the list as well as from the product details screen

• Cart management (Change the quantity, if item already in the cart increase or decrease the quantity, also item can be removed from cart

• If user is not logged in show the login button in the header

• Place the order

• User should be able to view the application without login but when he/she wants to place the order then user must be logged in.

• Show the popup when order placed successfully with random order id

• Logout should appear in dropdown when clicked on username (when logged in)

• Unit Testing should be done of at least 2 components



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
